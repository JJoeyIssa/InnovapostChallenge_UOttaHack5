<h1> Innovapost </h1>
Optimizing Delivery Routes: Developing an algorithm that can optimize delivery routes for Innovapostâ€™s couriers, taking into account factors such as minimizing delivery time and fuel consumption while taking into account traffic, weather and other real-time factors.

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>Take inspiration from the Traveling Salesman Problem --> Optimize the Delivery Routes (In relation to Time + Fuel consumption) using algorithm. </p>

<p> Traffic and Weather can be taking into account through a webpage presentation (soon to be shown below)</p>

<p>It'll help the couriers visualize their option with the nessary details updating frequently </p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
Webpage Design using HTML and CSS

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>My team and I decide to step away from our project at the time and instead attend the Deloitte, Nokia, Innovapost, DRDC and CSE workshops! <p>
